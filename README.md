water-ink-simulation
====================

My undergraduate design: a solution of dynamic water-ink simulation system.


## Introduction

Based on OpenGL, my most familiar graphics library, this is a functional solution to making effects, such as ink diffusing in water or smoke ascending in air, in computer games or animations.

Generally speaking, to solve this problem we need some in-depth understanding of fluid dynamics. But in this solution I WON'T INVOLVE ANITHING about those fucking physics equations.

Finally **I MADE IT**! Just enjoy!


## Progress

6/12/2013

* Finished finally.
* ![Preview](http://img14.poco.cn/mypoco/myphoto/20130612/13/5576878220130612135110066.png)


3/25/2013

* Read and understand Lax-Wendroff method and MacCormack method (for Euler equation, 2D non-viscuou fluid).

3/24/2013

* Finish reading fluid dynamics equations, and read the chapter about discretization, the key to CFD from pure physics.

3/23/2013

* Start reading _Computational Fluid Dynamics_ by John D. Anderson, a basic tutorial about CFD.
* Continue Reconstructing my codes.

3/21/2013

* Continue reading codes about fluid friction, which is essential in fluid simulation.
* Recoded my program, try solving problems using Mick's methods.
* Read and understand Mick's codes about advection, friction, diffusion and vorticity.

3/20/2013

* Read codes by Mick West (1687/3128 Lines). He rendered something just like this. It's not actually I want, but I shall learn something from his work.
