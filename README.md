water-ink-simulation
====================

My undergraduate design: a solution of dynamic water-ink simulation system.


## Introduction

Based on OpenGL, my most familiar graphics library, this is a functional solution to making effects, such as ink diffusing in water or smoke ascending in air, in computer games or animations.

Generally speaking, to solve this problem we need some in-depth understanding of fluid dynamics. But in this solution I WON'T INVOLVE ANITHING about those f**king physics equations.


## Progress

* Read codes by Mick West (1687/3128 Lines). He rendered something just like this. It's not actually I want, but I shall learn something from his work.

* Continue reading codes about fluid friction, which is essential in fluid simulation.
* Recoded my program, try solving problems using Mick's methods.
* Read and understand Mick's codes about advection, friction, diffusion and vorticity.
